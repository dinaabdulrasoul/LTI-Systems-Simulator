# LTI Systems Simulator

* A dynamic system has a set of inputs and returns a set of outputs. This dynamic system can be described by an input-output linear time-invariant equation or by state space representation. 
* This program aims to convert the input-output equation using its coefficients, type of input to the system (either unit step or unit impulse), and order of the system are
entered by the user in graphical user interface (GUI) using MATLAB.
* Then based on the userâ€™s inputs and calculations are done in order to plot the response (output of the system), compute the matrices (A,B,C,D) of the state space representation, and plots the state space variables. 
* The code does not use any ready-to-use functions and instead uses numerical approximation to represent all the derivatives in the LTI input-output equation.
